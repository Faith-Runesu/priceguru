This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
My project, PriceGuru, was born from a personal experience that deeply affected me. A few years ago, I decided to buy a laptop for my studies — a crucial tool for my education and future career. After months of saving and searching online, I found an HP 250 that seemed to fit my needs, priced at $450. Believing it was the best deal I could get, I made the purchase, feeling both excited and accomplished.

However, a week later, my excitement turned into disappointment when I discovered that my teacher had bought the exact same laptop for just $300. He had managed to find a deal that was almost half the price of what I paid. I was heartbroken, not just because of the money I had lost, but also because I realized how my limited ability to find the best price had cost me dearly. With the extra money, I could have bought a better laptop or saved for other essential expenses.

This experience stuck with me and became the driving force behind PriceGuru. I didn’t want anyone else to go through the same frustration and loss that I did. I wanted to create a tool that would help people in Zimbabwe, where every dollar counts, to find the best prices for electronics without the hassle and disappointment I faced.
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Project details
This project was done in 5 weeks 3 weeks for research and planning and 2 weeks for the actual development, I really enjoyed learning  web scraping in javascript. Disclaimer this was my first Nextjs project. Feel free to contribute. Constructive critisism will be appreciated.
